# Kafka-Streams
This repository contains 2 separate projects for implemented for the same purpose. One app contains the Code for Streams while the other contains the Consumer for that Kafka Topic. These projects can be run in parallel to totally avoid the use of console to see the output of the Kafka topic or to post a message to a Kafka topic.

This project was made :-
1. To demonstrate various example of Kafka Streams and Kafka Tables.
2. To totally avoid the use of console for any purpose whatsoever so that the data can be posted/consumed,
Topics can be managed all from the code.

Run both the apps in parallel to see the output produced by the streams.
